Respository of 21-cm reduction scripts.

Right now this is the kitchen sink. Over the course of the next couple
months, we'd like to refine into something sleek for both Local Group
and EveryTHINGS work.

Contents:

vla_heracles/

Contains the produres used in the VLAHERACLES reduction. They used an
older version of CASA (~3.0) in ~fall 2010. These are parts that go
together into slightly individualized reduction scripts for each
galaxy.

m31_evla/

Contains the scripts used to reduce the EVLA M31 HI data. This
approach was to store switching information in a few text files, along
with customized flagging scripts for each galaxy. Then these scripts
were run.
